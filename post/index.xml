      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to have a blog for a while now and am finally getting to it. Do I
care if anyone reads it? Nope. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly for me to remember things that I&amp;rsquo;ve
done that I think are interesting. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s possible for someone to stumble
across this and find something useful. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible that no one besides
me will ever read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://spf13.com/&#34;&gt;spf13&lt;/a&gt; at Strange Loop last year and found out that
he has a cool and fast static site generator called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.spf13.com/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to use it for this blog. Also I&amp;rsquo;m
currently not that great at CSS so I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com/kube/&#34;&gt;Kube&lt;/a&gt;
for that. I think Hugo and Kube and a lot of other things are pretty dang cool
and am glad that their authors have shared their work.&lt;/p&gt;
