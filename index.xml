      <title>Nerdy Nights Week 4</title>

      <description>Today I learned about color palettes and sprites. I also learned about a general strategy for updating graphics. The strategy appears to keep sprite data from $0200 to $02ff. Then on NMI update data to set the tile, position, and several other attributes of sprites that need to change. Then setup a DMA transfer of this memory block to the PPU&amp;rsquo;s sprite memory.
I was able to edit the demo code to have the tile and positions of a couple of sprites change on every NMI.</description>

      <description>I read the Nerdy Nights weeks 2 &amp;amp; 3 tutorials. I learned a lot more about the NES Architecture, memory, and how the 6502 processor fits into everything.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I am surprised by this but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me that sending commands to the PPU (picture processing unit) is just writing data to specific memory locations. For some reason I assumed that interfacing with things outside the CPU would be via some specific instructions.</description>

      <title>Initial NES / 6502 Dev Machine Setup</title>

      <description>I looked for lists online of tools I&amp;rsquo;ll need to build my Moon Lander game and found the following from FRITZVD. Below is what I&amp;rsquo;ve got setup so far:
 VirtualBox VM w/ the minimal install of Ubuntu Mate (Mate is lightweight and runs well in a VM) Default gVim from apt My Vim setup from my kapp-vim repo The NESASM assembler, built from source. Gimp for making graphics. Although I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be just using white and black for the initial version.</description>

      <title>A bit of 6502 Assembly</title>

      <description>For some time I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how fun it would be to build a copy of an old Moon Landing game. I recently discovered that there are tools for writing NES roms from 6502 assembly, C, and JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve got an emulator running on a Raspberry Pi 2 with a SNES controller. I think it would be super fun to build and play a homemade game on it.
To that end I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through Nick Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Easy 6502 Tutorial and it was a lot of fun.</description>

      <title>Datomic Datalog Rollup</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at different ways to calculate roll-up aggregations in a tree of data. These calculations can be done with recursive algorithms. Here I show an example in Datomic.
The datomic schema. Just three attributes: :o/name, :o/parent, and :o/x (the rollup field). [{:db/ident :o/name :db/valueType :db.type/string :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one :db/unique :db.unique/value :db/id #db/id[:db.part/db] :db.install/_attribute :db.part/db} {:db/ident :o/parent :db/valueType :db.type/ref :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one :db/id #db/id[:db.part/db] :db.install/_attribute :db.part/db} {:db/ident :o/x :db/valueType :db.</description>

      <title>Wires DSL w/ Clojure Spec</title>

      <description>A while ago I found Beautiful Racket by Matthew Butterick. As I worked through the tutorials I found myself wanting to try the same thing with Clojure. Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how I implemented the Wires language from Beautiful Racket in Clojure with spec and macros. I think it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad pattern for building complicated macros in Clojure. In this case the macro will take a program written in the Wires language and produce Clojure code that computes the result.</description>
