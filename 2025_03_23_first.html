        What is this? It's an old fashioned blog of sorts written in plain HTML
        CSS, and JavaScript. But why not more tech? I think I'm too young to be
        old and grumpy about tech. On the other hand maybe not. I like
        repairable things, <a href="https://github.com/mtbkapp/kapp-vim">Vim</a>,
        and internet free appliances.  Also I think this is the peak of HVAC
        control design for vehicles.
