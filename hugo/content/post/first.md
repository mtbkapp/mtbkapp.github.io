I've wanted to have a blog for a while now and am finally getting to it. Do I 
care if anyone reads it? Nope. It's mainly for me to remember things that I've 
done that I think are interesting. I guess it's possible for someone to stumble 
across this and find something useful. It's also possible that no one besides 
me will ever read it. 

I met [spf13](http://spf13.com/) at Strange Loop last year and found out that
he has a cool and fast static site generator called 
[Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/). I decided to use it for this blog. Also I'm 
currently not that great at CSS so I used [Kube](http://imperavi.com/kube/) 
for that. I think Hugo and Kube and a lot of other things are pretty dang cool
and am glad that their authors have shared their work.
