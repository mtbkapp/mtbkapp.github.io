In a previous [post](../daylight) I wrote a tiny bit of 
[Clojure](http://clojure.org) and some JavaScript/[D3](http://d3js.org) to 
*see* how the amount of daylight changes through out the year in Salt Lake City.
I wanted to see how daylight changes in a couple of other places so I changed
the code from the last post and wrote the following.


<p id="vis"></p>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/more-daylight/style.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/d3.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/underscore.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/more-daylight/vis.js"></script>
